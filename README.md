# CLFS-B1-T8-Smart-City-IoT
# Monitoring System
This system is capable of monitoring the temperature, humidity and noise levels in the surrounding region. It can also detect earthquakes and fire and details all the information collected in a LCD. This project requires the following components:-
1) Raspberry Pi 3B+
2) LCD
3) Smoke detector (MQ2 smoke and flammable gas sensor)
4) Flame Sensor (KY-026)
5) Temperature and humidity sensor (DHT-22)
6) Vibration sensor (SW-420)
7) Sound sensor ( with LM393)
8) Analog to digital converter
9) Buzzer

# Phase-1
1) With the help of DHT-22 temperature and humidity sensor, the system will monitor temperature and humidity continously and display the readings using the LCD screen.
2) Along with monitoring temperature and humidity continously, it will also be able to detect an earthquake or a fire. When it detect any, it will produce a warning sound using a buzzer.
